# Introduction to Groundwater Modeling Using MODFLOW

Instructors: Michael Fienen, Joseph Hughes, Chris Langevin, and Josh Larsen

January 6-10, 2025

San Diego State University

San Diego, CA

This 5-day course presents an introduction to groundwater flow simulation using MODFLOW.  The course will be taught using MODFLOW 6, the sixth major release of the MODFLOW program.  In addition to discussing the feature and mechanics of using MODFLOW 6, this course provides a review of the basic concepts of groundwater flow and emphasizes the process of simulation analysis.  A series of problem sets are presented that are designed to illustrate concepts such as the development of conceptual models and strategies for model calibration.  This course is intended as an introduction to groundwater flow modeling.  Hydrologists with extensive modeling experience looking primarily for an introduction to the new features of MODFLOW 6 should not take this course.
