# Some PEST++ related resources

### Documentation
The definitive guide (online, so often updated) for PEST++ is [here](https://github.com/usgs/pestpp/blob/master/documentation/pestpp_users_manual.md).

### Executables
The best place for getting the latest executables is [here](https://github.com/usgs/pestpp/releases). Or you can use the [`get_pestpp`](https://pyemu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/pyemu/utils/get_pestpp/index.html) functionality in `pyemu` as well.

### A couple recent papers
The paper on the GLM maths is [here](https://doi.org/10.1111/gwat.13433).

For a complete workflow example (getting a bit dated, but still a good reference) see:
